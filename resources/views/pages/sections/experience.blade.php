                                The time I spent at Perfume Click was spent looking at transforming their 10+ year old
                                back end warehousing system in to a micro-serviced platform. This was a great time for
                                me because I was able to learn exactly what micro-services were and how they were
                                implemented on the back-end.

                                First, we took parts of the system that were important and tried to replicate small

                                existing system to see if they would work. The idea was that if they did, we could
                                remove the old parts and start on the next micro-service gradually making the old legacy
                                system smaller and smaller.

                                half an hour for development was unreasonable. My wordpress skills weren't the best and
                                all of the client sites were in wordpress. I was hired there to take part in converting
                                the existing wordpress sites in to Laravel/Lumen sites. It later transpired that there
                                was no intention to move over to Laravel and when I proposed the idea of building a
                                platform to help customers manage their own content, marketing and other business related
                                items, I was shot down and told to just get the sites done in Wordpress.

                                During my time at Watt Utilities, I headed up and re-created their existing CRM system.
                                The end goal was to create a faster, more user friendly system that had a bunch of extra
                                features that were planned in the development roadmap.

                                weren't working for them (e.g anything that made their jobs slow or more painful). After
                                I was able to find out what was bad, I logged all the other parts and classed those bits

                                stripped out everything that was bad. I made a new GitHub repository and stored the initial
                                commit in there. Next, I sat with my manager and discussed a few points to work on including;
                                system account security, refactoring useless site-wide code, a sub-roadmap for where the new
                                features would be implemented and how the implementation would be performed.

                                staff loved it. There was plans for me to stay with Watt Utilities but other commitments
